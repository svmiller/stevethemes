`stevethemes` is an R package including various `{ggplot2}` themes and
theme elements that I find useful and aesthetically pleasing. It also
includes some various helper functions for adjusting plots to taste for
either the web or a printed manuscript. Its use heavily implies, but
does not formally require, free fonts you can download from Google. In
particular, it suggests use of Titillium Web, Open Sans, Fira Sans, and
Crimson Pro. The package has simple forms of these fonts available for
you to install on your computer, though you can easily download these
fonts (and more) from Google as well.

## Installation

You can install this on CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("stevethemes")
```

The development version may also have some extra goodies not yet
published on CRAN. You can install the development version of
`stevethemes` from Github via the `devtools` package. I suppose using
the `remotes` package would work as well.

``` r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/stevethemes")
```
