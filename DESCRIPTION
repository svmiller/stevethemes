Description: These are a compilation of my preferred themes for `ggplot2` and
    related theme elements (like colors and a palettes). I believe these themes
    and theme elements are aesthetically pleasing, both for pedagogical 
    instruction and the presentation of applied statistical research to a wide
    audience. These themes imply routine use of easily obtained/free fonts.
